# Hi, Iâ€™m *@JanSalecker*

ðŸ‘€<br>Iâ€™m interested in coding, music, design & DIY

ðŸ’»<br>Iâ€™m currently working at [Medienmonster]([url](https://medienmonster.com/)) and continue learning app & web development. 

ðŸ¤œ ðŸ¤›<br>Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on simple things for the moment. I'd like to get better in git and coding. If you have a nice little music app going on in C/C++, feel free to let me know! Thanks!

ðŸ¤“<br>I can do proofreading in English and German for your documentation.
